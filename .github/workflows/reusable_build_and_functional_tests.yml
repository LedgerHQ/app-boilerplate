name: Build and run functional tests using ragger entry point

# This workflow will build the app and then run functional tests using the Ragger framework upon Speculos emulation.
# It calls a reusable workflow developed by Ledger's internal developer team to build the application and upload the
# resulting binaries.
# It then calls another reusable workflow to run the Ragger tests on the compiled application binary.
#
# This workflow is itself written as a reusable workflow so it can be triggered by itself (file
# build_and_functional_tests.yml), or triggered by external repositories CI (used by various non regression workflows
# we have). You do not need to keep this split, so you can merge this file and build_and_functional_tests.yml on your
# fork
