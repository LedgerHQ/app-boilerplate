## About

This documentation describes the APDU messages interface to communicate with the Boilerplate application.

The application covers the following functionalities :

- Get a public Boilerplate address given a BIP 32 path
- Sign a basic Boilerplate transaction given a BIP 32 path and raw transaction
- Retrieve the Boilerplate app version
- Retrieve the Boilerplate app name

The application interface can be accessed over HID or BLE

## APDUs

### GET BOILERPLATE PUBLIC ADDRESS

#### Description

This command returns the public key for the given BIP 32 path.

The address can be optionally checked on the device before being returned.

### SIGN BOILERPLATE TRANSACTION

#### Description

This command signs a Boilerplate transaction after having the user validate the transactions parameters.

The input data is the RLP encoded transaction streamed to the device in 255 bytes maximum data chunks.
